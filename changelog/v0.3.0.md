## Binding Definition

```php
/**
 * @var string
 * @Binding(key="firstname")
 */
private $firstname;

/**
 * @var string
 * @Binding(key="lastname", setter="setOtherName")
 */
private $lastname;

/**
 * @var integer
 * @Binding(key="age", type="integer")
 */
private $age;

/**
 * @var string
 * @Binding()
 */
private $userEmail;
```

- Changed property name from `name` to `key` for binding definition
- You must define the `key` property. It's the array value's key.
- The `setter` property is used if you want to use another setter.
- The `type` property is used if you want to make a type check. A BinderTypeException is thrown if the type doesn't correspond.
