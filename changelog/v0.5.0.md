# v0.5.0

## Min and Max Validation

```php
/**
 * @var integer
 * @Binding(key="age", type="integer", min=0, max=100)
 */
private $age;
```

- The `min` and `max` properties check if the value is in the range defined by these two properties
- If not, a specific exception is thrown
- Works with numbers (int/float), strings (length) and arrays (count)
